# Modelling framework HERMES

HERMES is an individual-based, health and economic risk-stratified microsimulation framework designed to evaluate the population impact and cost-effectiveness of healthcare programs. The accronym stands for "Health, Epidemic and Economic R-based Microsimulation Engine for individual-based Simulations". As such this framework is deveolopted as a health, epidemic and economic microsimulation engine in R that models heterogeneous individuals over time to evaluate disease dynamics and the impact of healthcare interventions under alternative policy scenarios.
